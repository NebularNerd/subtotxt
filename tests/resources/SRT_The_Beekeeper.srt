1
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,208
That's them in there just like that?

2
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,645
Just like that.

3
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,996
I wouldn't go in there for a day or two.

4
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,847
Heard the expression
kick the hornet's nest?

5
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,714
I'll stay right here. Thank you.

6
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:40,915
Those things scare me to death.

7
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,510
They been killing my honey bees.

8
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,001
A few days unchecked,

9
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,461
they'll wipe out the whole colony.

10
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:47,922
What are you gonna do with them?

11
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:49,358
Well, that's between me and them,

12
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,404
if you don't mind.

13
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,623
That's okay.

14
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,886
I understand these things.

15
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,108
I just wanted to thank you

16
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:02,067
for putting up with me,

17
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,364
and all of my bees.

18
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,029
This place was crabgrass and weeds,

19
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,310
and you brought it back to life.

20
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,736
You're a blessing.

21
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,267
No one's ever taken care of me before.

22
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll, uh...

23
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,482
Mr. Clay...

24
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,966
Come back at suppertime.
Let me feed you.

25
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,463
Boss.

26
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:42,322
- You got something, yeah?
- I got one.

27
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,038
I want it. I need it.

28
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,518
Hey, put it in my ear.

29
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,347
Get this fucking hippie shit down, please.

30
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,220
United Data Group. Good
afternoon. This is Boyd.

31
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,265
How may I help you?

32
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,136
Boyd.

33
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,356
Uh, hello. I just got a message saying

34
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,358
that there's a problem with my computer.

35
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,142
<i>Don't you worry. The
message you received</i>

36
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:03,362
<i>is from our United Data
Group antivirus software.</i>

37
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,728
<i>It's part of the software package</i>

38
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,380
<i>that you pre-installed on your computer.</i>

39
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,715
I'm sorry. I'm not a computer person.

40
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:10,718
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

41
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,161
Now, our records show that you actually

42
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:22,032
have an older version on your account.

43
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,644
So what I'm going to need
you to do is uninstall that

44
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:26,428
<i>and install the latest version.</i>

45
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,343
Well, I have no idea how to do that.

46
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,910
My daughter set up everything for me.

47
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,380
<i>Well, I would recommend</i>

48
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,846
<i>you take your computer
to an IT specialist.</i>

49
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,436
However, keep in mind

50
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,438
that you will lose all your data,

51
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,853
since they'll have to
replace the hard drive.

52
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,791
I'm pretty remote out here.

53
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,491
Everything I have is on the computer.

54
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,885
<i>Okay. There is actually</i>

55
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,842
<i>a software package
that you can download</i>

56
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:51,148
that would allow me to reinstall remotely.

57
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,606
All right. Tell me what to do.

58
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:57,038
It's okay. Can you, uh, can you type this,

59
00:06:57,063 --> 00:07:00,108
Friendly friend dot net?

60
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,221
<i>Spelled just how it sounds.</i>

61
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,032
Okay. I'm there.

62
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,468
And there should be a button

63
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,556
on your screen that says "install."

64
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,905
<i>Can you click on that button?</i>

65
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,111
I clicked the button.

66
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,885
So you're about to see some windows

67
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,519
open, close on your desktop,

68
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,608
<i>as I reinstall the virus shield for you.</i>

69
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,510
Okay.

70
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:20,743
I hope you fucking clowns
are paying attention.

71
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,417
You stick to the script,

72
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,619
but not so much that you
sound like a goddamn robot.

73
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,837
All right?

74
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,536
She has got 10K checking,

75
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,452
life insurance annuity, Roth IRA,

76
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,714
teacher's pension and...

77
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:37,325
Holy fucking shit!

78
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,153
All right.

79
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,285
She is a signatory

80
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:44,332
on a $2 million dollar account.

81
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,466
Some, uh... It's some fucking charity.

82
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,860
All right, kids, let the strip mining begin.

83
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,647
Ooh. My computer's going crazy.

84
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:55,416
<i>Totally normal.</i>

85
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,799
<i>Just do not touch your keyboard.</i>

86
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,528
Because of this inconvenience,

87
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,008
I'm going to credit back
your subscription fees.

88
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,183
How about that?

89
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:11,189
I've gone ahead and deposited $500

90
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:13,717
into the account ending 020.

91
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:15,482
Oh, that's not my account.

92
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:17,247
That's an account that I manage.

93
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,758
Can you log into that account

94
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,542
and verify the transfer,
please, Miss Parker?

95
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,459
Just hold on.

96
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,288
Yes, there's...

97
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,552
There's a transfer for $50,000?

98
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,033
Set the hook with sympathy.

99
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,168
Miss Parker, I...

100
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,322
I made a terrible mistake.

101
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:40,869
<i>I was supposed to credit you 500,</i>

102
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:42,913
<i>but I don't know, I got a stuck key here.</i>

103
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,494
<i>I'm gonna lose my job here.</i>

104
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,564
I got kids.

105
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,416
I ain't got fucking kids.

106
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:53,580
Oh, I don't want you to
get in trouble, but...

107
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,623
I could wire the amount back.

108
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:01,197
I will need a different password though.

109
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:02,657
One second.

110
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:06,278
This is the master password
for all her accounts.

111
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,158
Okay, so the second we get
it, we zero out everything.

112
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,161
Um...

113
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,600
You know, I, um...

114
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:21,648
I think I should call the bank. Hm?

115
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,387
<i>You know what? You're probably right.</i>

116
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:26,000
But there goes my job,

117
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:29,307
and there goes all your data.

118
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:39,970
All my kids' pictures
are on this computer.

119
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:44,661
Okay.

120
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,214
Boom! Fucking yes!

121
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,893
That is what I am
talking about! Come on!

122
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:58,074
Let me fucking hear it! I
fucking love you people!

123
00:09:58,075 --> 00:09:59,423
I fucking love you!

124
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:05,101
Hello?

125
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:06,911
Hello? You still there?

126
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:16,806
Uh-oh.

127
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:20,737
Oh.

128
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,248
Oh.

129
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,105
What did I do?

130
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,573
Stupid...

131
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,728
Mrs. Parker?

132
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:00,934
Don't move.

133
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,723
Don't you fucking move.

134
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:05,637
Drop the knife.

135
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:10,974
Hands behind your back.

136
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:17,649
Slowly get on your knees
one knee at a time.

137
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,788
Now, who the fuck are you...

138
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,921
and what are you doing
in my mother's house?

139
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,230
Verona...

140
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,333
I'm so sorry.

141
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,200
How do you know my...

142
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,719
Mom.

143
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,682
<i>Until we can clear him,
he's our best and only perp.</i>

144
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,119
Clear him?

145
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,511
Agent Parker, I know that's your mother.

146
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:55,763
I understand.

147
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:59,185
But there's a world where
she committed suicide.

148
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,088
Suicide? You can't be serious.

149
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,744
That woman loved life
more than anybody I know.

150
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,964
But by all means, let's
just completely ignore

151
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,009
the big white dude in
her house with a knife.

152
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,419
Get him up.

153
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:16,838
Come on.

154
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:22,410
It's Clay, right?

155
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,106
Adam Clay?

156
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,075
I don't have much to say.

157
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,185
Mr. Clay, we just got
a couple of questions.

158
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,590
Like, what the fuck were you doing

159
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,853
in my mother's house?

160
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,700
I was bringing her a jar of honey.

161
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,250
A jar of honey.

162
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,861
Who the fuck are
you? Winnie-the-Pooh?

163
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:40,607
I keep bees.

164
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,692
How do you know my mother?

165
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,477
I rent some space in the barn from her.

166
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,653
I have a signed lease.

167
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,744
But what the fuck were
you doing in her house?

168
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,704
She didn't answer when I knocked.

169
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,130
I noted her car in the driveway.

170
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,361
I heard the smoke alarm and I entered.

171
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,287
You "noted"?

172
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,325
You got a law enforcement background?

173
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,865
I told you, I take care of bees.

174
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:53,544
Oh, my God.

175
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,222
His hands tested negative
for gunshot residue.

176
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,703
But the prints on the
gun were your mother's.

177
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,924
It seems, sadly, it was suicide.

178
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:38,720
Mr. Clay, I need to
apologize for last night.

179
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,289
I realize I may have
been a little aggressive.

180
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,435
That's understandable.

181
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,443
Could I interest you in
something a bit stronger?

182
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,825
No.

183
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,990
But I'll sit with you if you like.

184
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,009
No, thank you.

185
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,537
I wanted to thank you

186
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,607
for taking care of my mom.

187
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:21,034
I tried to stay in her
life as much as I could.

188
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,739
Obviously, I could have done a better job.

189
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,377
Being old can be a lonely thing.

190
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,992
Turn a certain age, you cease
to exist. Cease to matter.

191
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:36,430
Used to be a part of life, of the family.

192
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,409
Part of the hive, I guess you could say.

193
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,005
There's some British Isles
hiding in your accent.

194
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:47,828
I was born there.

195
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,750
I hated that she was out here alone.

196
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,887
She wouldn't leave.

197
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,286
There's too many memories.

198
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:05,911
You know, I think I
know why she liked you.

199
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,153
You're just like my brother.

200
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,708
He was in MARSOC, a Marine Raider.

201
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,943
He was killed a few
years ago kicking doors.

202
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:19,130
She loved him.

203
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:21,106
He'd mow the lawn

204
00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:22,779
and you'd think he invented fire.

205
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,566
You know, while I
graduated the FBI Academy

206
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,743
and she said, "Oh, that's nice."

207
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,122
She got scammed.

208
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:37,171
Somebody emptied out all her accounts,

209
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,753
her savings, her retirement.

210
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:42,756
Got every penny. Maxed
out all her cards.

211
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,671
She was an educator,

212
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,872
director of a charity for kids.

213
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:49,497
They got two million out of that account.

214
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,588
You know who did it?

215
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,638
I talked to an agent in
our cyber-crimes office.

216
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:57,567
This crew's been operating for two years

217
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,286
and we don't even have names.

218
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:01,365
And even if we did, good
luck building an indictment

219
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:02,763
that would stand up in court.

220
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,169
Some defense attorney
would just argue that

221
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:07,677
the elderly victim agreed

222
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:09,742
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

223
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,102
Taking from an elderly person

224
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:13,833
is as bad as stealing from a child.

225
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:16,917
Maybe worse.

226
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,918
Someone hurts a child,

227
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,317
there are parents.

228
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,050
People who care, ready to step in.

229
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,323
Someone hurts an older person...

230
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:32,023
sometimes they're left to
face the hornets alone.

231
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,216
Because either it goes unnoticed...

232
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:39,988
or no one cares.

233
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,760
I care.

234
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:45,733
And I'm stubborn.

235
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:48,037
And so help me God,

236
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,694
I'm going to get these
motherfuckers who did this.

237
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,441
I need to take care of the hive.

238
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,801
You've been up all night.

239
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,361
The hive is more important.

240
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,396
What are you doing?

241
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,380
- I thought you retired.
<i>- I did.</i>

242
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,905
I need a favor.

243
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:29,603
<i>What kind of favor?</i>

244
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,195
A name and address.

245
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,099
<i>- Easy.</i>
- Not easy.

246
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,695
Even the FBI can't find these people.

247
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:41,030
Well, we're not the FBI, are we?

248
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,796
<i>Shoot me the deets and stand by.</i>

249
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,380
Yeah.

250
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:52,471
You weren't kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

251
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,061
They're routing all over the world.

252
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,410
But you found them?

253
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,552
Sure. But who are these people?

254
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,769
I'm gonna find out.

255
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:06,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,243
The hell you think you're going, pal?

257
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:10,314
This United Data Group?

258
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:11,732
Don't know nothing about that.

259
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:14,661
This is private property,
and you're trespassing.

260
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,283
I'm going inside.

261
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:18,644
I'm going to burn it down.

262
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:20,914
Yeah, that's not happening, buddy.

263
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,437
You're not going any-fucking-where

264
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,396
except right the fuck
back the way you came.

265
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,466
Do you know what they do here?

266
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:29,228
Buddy, I'm counting to three.

267
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,578
One, two, three.

268
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,873
There. I did it for you.

269
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:38,466
You aware this is a criminal outfit?

270
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,629
Scamming the weakest in our society.

271
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:42,841
Stealing everything they have.

272
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:44,859
Do you know that's who you work for?

273
00:20:57,935 --> 00:20:59,625
<i>I'm looking for the call center.</i>

274
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,215
Yeah, you're in the right place.

275
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,957
You just have to sign in here.

276
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:09,310
Tell any other companies in the building

277
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,311
to evacuate now.

278
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,923
- There's going to be a fire.
- Okay. Th...

279
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:14,924
Thanks.

280
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,763
Hang up the phone.

281
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:23,159
Nah, I'm good, buddy. I'm
just doing my thing here.

282
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,583
Hang up the phone.

283
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:30,646
Uh, Miss Perkins, so sorry, I'll have to

284
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:32,544
- call you right back.
- Everyone...

285
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,622
I need your attention, please.

286
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,338
Repeat after me.

287
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:40,513
I will never steal from the weak

288
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:42,115
and the vulnerable again.

289
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,122
I sent you a department download,

290
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:47,758
and we'll find out what's going on...

291
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:02,756
Repeat after me.

292
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:05,710
I will never steal from the weak

293
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:07,126
and the vulnerable again.

294
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,935
I will never steal from the weak

295
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:10,546
and the vulnerable again.

296
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:15,029
To help you keep that promise,

297
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,901
I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.

298
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,645
Might be a good time to go home.

299
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,038
Oh, my God!

300
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,780
It's gas! MAN 4: Fucking psycho.

301
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:29,870
It's gas!

302
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:32,708
It's gas! It's gas!

303
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,051
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

304
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:40,271
What the fuck, bro?

305
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,056
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

306
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,058
I'm a beekeeper.

307
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:46,409
I protect the hive.

308
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:49,988
Sometimes I use fire
to smoke out hornets.

309
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,502
This a multi-million
dollar operation, asshole.

310
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,223
Okay, so you can't come up here,

311
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,685
white-knighting shit.

312
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,729
Will you stomp his ass out, please?

313
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,552
I got it. You fucking get him.

314
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:21,771
You fucking get him!

315
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:34,482
Bet you feel really proud of yourself.

316
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,566
Mister...?

317
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,036
Uh...

318
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:01,527
- Uh, uh, Garnett.
- Mr. Garnett.

319
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,965
I don't care if your
friends here live or die.

320
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:09,011
The next call from your
little phishing scam

321
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,491
to this call center

322
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,754
will make a spark across these wires.

323
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,149
Given all of the gasoline fumes in here,

324
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,978
I promise you...

325
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,024
anything alive in here won't be.

326
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:29,597
Uh, guys, we might want to dip out.

327
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,407
Hey. What's going on?

328
00:24:57,408 --> 00:25:02,064
Uh, let me get flat white,
oat milk, of course,

329
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,786
and, uh, extra shot of espresso.

330
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:05,377
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

331
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:09,275
Good morning. Did we get
the otoro and the uni in?

332
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,334
- Yes, sure.
- We did?

333
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:13,076
- Yes.
- Fucking finally. Great.

334
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,644
- Hey, Michaela.
- Yes.

335
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,192
It... it came back. The whole thing. Yeah.

336
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,021
And it's like I can barely fucking move.

337
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:23,661
It's all tweaked.

338
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,599
- Oh, those are nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

339
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:29,544
- Those the new bowls?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,226
- That's perfect. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

341
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,013
What? I'm in a meeting.

342
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,068
<i>You said hit me on voice</i>

343
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,349
<i>if there's an emergency.</i>

344
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,013
Okay. Right. Well, uh...

345
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:49,005
It seems we had a disgruntled customer.

346
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:52,997
Uh, I just can't comprehend
why you're bothering me.

347
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:54,675
Just get in touch with the attorney

348
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,865
and start shoving back.

349
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:59,661
Well, yeah, I don't think
that legal's gonna help much.

350
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:02,255
Okay, tell me what the
fuck is going on right now.

351
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:04,755
This dude just strolls in

352
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,685
saying we're stealing from people,

353
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,529
<i>and he just tears through
all my security guys,</i>

354
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,050
<i>like, fucking tissue paper and, um...</i>

355
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:14,310
And what?

356
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:16,792
And he burns the place to the ground.

357
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,646
<i>Yeah. The call center is gone.</i>

358
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:22,898
<i>I'm standing here staring
at a $30 million building,</i>

359
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:25,969
it's now a giant fucking ashtray.

360
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:28,518
Four people didn't get out.

361
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:29,923
You're telling me that this asshole

362
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:31,208
burnt the entire building down

363
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,068
and dropped four fucking bodies?

364
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,139
Yeah, that's not exactly a
disgruntled customer, is it?

365
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:36,719
<i>Who did this? Give
me a name right now.</i>

366
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:38,572
Sir, I don't have it.

367
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,816
<i>All the cameras and the
drives burned up in the fire.</i>

368
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,644
He had a hat.

369
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,733
Oh, he had a hat. Okay.

370
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:46,837
I'm gonna hit you back. All right?

371
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:48,867
I got to go big-dog this shit for a minute.

372
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:57,093
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- About what?

373
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:58,807
What? What? No, nothing.

374
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:01,601
I mean, if I had a friend
who, like, had a call center

375
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:03,867
and someone burned it down,
maybe killed some people,

376
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:05,882
you could get him, right?

377
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:07,484
Get him?

378
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:09,017
Yeah, like disappear the problem.

379
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,687
Come on.

380
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:12,679
I'll be an hour.

381
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:14,879
That's way above my pay grade.

382
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:16,740
You literally ran the CIA,

383
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,375
and you're telling me you can't just find

384
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,757
some guy in Massachusetts?

385
00:27:19,782 --> 00:27:21,749
Listen, this sounds like
a job for the police.

386
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:23,337
I just need a name.

387
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,195
Well, you won't get it from me.

388
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,960
And you keep me a million miles away

389
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:29,351
from your metaverse meth lab

390
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:30,601
or whatever it is.

391
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,346
Yup.

392
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:34,257
So check it out.

393
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:36,523
Daddy can't hold your hand on this one.

394
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:39,184
Uh, this is clearly some
kind of crime of passion,

395
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,363
spur of the moment,

396
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:42,090
someone snapped, like, whatever.

397
00:27:42,115 --> 00:27:43,464
But, uh, what we're going to do is

398
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,750
I'm going to send you some credentials,

399
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:46,253
you're going to log into our cloud

400
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:47,536
and you're going to
look at anyone connected

401
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,099
to the last few deals
you closed. All right?

402
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:50,645
<i>Just, I don't know, start there.</i>

403
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,081
And, like, what if I find this guy?

404
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,323
Then what?

405
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:56,481
You get a wrecking crew together

406
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:57,518
and you go <i>Goodfellas</i> on him.

407
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,185
I mean, come on, you're
a connected guy, right?

408
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:00,353
Do you understand?

409
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,576
Yeah. No, I understand. I, uh...

410
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:06,206
I'll get it done.

411
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,725
It's called a day off.

412
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:25,878
<i>V, you good?</i>

413
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:27,706
Yeah, I'm great. Why?

414
00:28:28,736 --> 00:28:30,557
I mean, you did lose
your mother yesterday.

415
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:34,650
Yeah.

416
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,056
<i>What do you want, Wiley?</i>

417
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:40,734
Are you leaving? Please don't go.

418
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,761
I'm going to yoga.

419
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,415
Remember United Data Group?

420
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:49,926
<i>Go on.</i>

421
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,082
You sober enough to drive?

422
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,125
Yeah.

423
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:02,342
Give us a few seconds, thank you.

424
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,134
Where's mine?

425
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,439
It's an old cup from my car

426
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:09,385
with instant and gas station hot water.

427
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,322
Ew.

428
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:11,573
- You want a sip?
- No.

429
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:16,166
So the fire fried all the CCTV footage.

430
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:19,087
Receptionist said she saw
some jacked dude in his 40s,

431
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:20,938
manhandled security and walked in

432
00:29:20,963 --> 00:29:22,151
with a couple gas cans.

433
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,459
This clown car saw everything,
but no one's talking.

434
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,260
They're all frequent fliers with perjury,

435
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:30,460
fraud and cyber BeEFs.

436
00:29:30,912 --> 00:29:34,046
Fucking scumbags. I
want IDs on all of them.

437
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:39,314
You know, this is just the tip
of, like, 20 spears, right?

438
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:41,646
Can I just have this moment?

439
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,754
Eloise Parker.

440
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:01,353
Yeah, I took her for over
two million yesterday.

441
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:03,736
She's, uh... she's Black,

442
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,682
widow, just has a daughter in Boston.

443
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:07,455
I don't think this is it, but, you know.

444
00:30:10,568 --> 00:30:13,424
You said your boy has
an old-ass pickup truck.

445
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:15,786
That's him.

446
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,548
What the hell are those?

447
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,307
Fucking beehives.

448
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,400
Yeah, dickhead was talking about them.

449
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:36,138
I guess he's a, like, bee lover.

450
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:38,636
You know what?

451
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:41,663
He breaks my shit, you break his shit.

452
00:31:29,603 --> 00:31:31,300
Where you at, bee boy?

453
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:35,431
You fucking hiding, bitch?

454
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:38,151
Come out and fucking face us!

455
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:48,515
Bye, bitch, now!

456
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:50,560
Let's go!

457
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,108
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

458
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,806
Can someone, like, fucking help me?

459
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:06,338
Fuck.

460
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:09,117
No! I'm okay.

461
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:13,635
We can talk about this.

462
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,139
We can talk about this.

463
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:17,164
Let's just work this out,
me and you. We can fix...

464
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,822
No, no!

465
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:23,900
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

466
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:39,095
So, help me understand
because I'm a little confused.

467
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,685
What's the nature of your business?

468
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,689
Don't know nothing about no business.

469
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:44,456
So then why are people just wiring you

470
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,935
their entire life savings?

471
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,736
Must be your winning personality.

472
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:49,765
They got us lawyers,

473
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,236
so maybe you want to talk to them.

474
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,950
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

475
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:56,924
Did you steal it out of
a casket, you dog fucker?

476
00:33:56,949 --> 00:33:58,689
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh...

477
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,340
Verona, if you're done shitting all over

478
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:02,102
this gentleman's civil rights,

479
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,737
can I speak to you for a moment?

480
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:06,273
That's a nice shirt.

481
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:10,946
- V.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

482
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,181
I'm an asshole.

483
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:16,065
Oh, so you like fires?

484
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:17,939
Yeah, today I do.

485
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,473
Good, 'cause, uh, today's your lucky day.

486
00:34:21,865 --> 00:34:23,258
'Cause apparently, your mother's house

487
00:34:23,282 --> 00:34:25,109
is on fire, too, and some other shit.

488
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,715
- Let's go.
- Wait. What?

489
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:29,284
Yeah. Shit's on fire. Let's go.

490
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,002
You good?

491
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:48,956
V, you okay?

492
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:51,853
Yeah.

493
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:55,679
- That's a new one.
- Jesus Christ.

494
00:34:55,704 --> 00:34:58,064
Where's Maggie? Hey, Maggie, ID?

495
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:04,467
- United Data Group.
- Well, he's handsome.

496
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:06,800
Thank you.

497
00:35:09,036 --> 00:35:10,123
Are you okay?

498
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:12,346
Yeah, Wiley, I'm good. I'm good.

499
00:35:13,332 --> 00:35:15,159
You think there's even
the remotest chance

500
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,924
that the dude who burned
down United Data Group

501
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,190
is the same guy renting this spot

502
00:35:19,214 --> 00:35:20,541
from your mother?

503
00:35:23,978 --> 00:35:25,228
The beekeeper.

504
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:30,812
I lost my virginity in that barn.

505
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,618
Fucking shit.

506
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,756
The universe is going to have to wait.

507
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,244
I gotta take this.

508
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,528
Yo, what's up, play a?

509
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:05,743
This is the part where you tell me

510
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:06,937
what a good job you did,

511
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:09,572
and I put you on a G6 to
Hawaii to chill for a week.

512
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:11,430
I'm so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

513
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:13,788
Did you fuck this up?

514
00:36:13,813 --> 00:36:15,496
Are you fucking crying right now?

515
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,045
I'm not crying. I'm bleeding.

516
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:21,003
Bleeding? Why are you bleeding?

517
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,353
What do you mean, bleeding?

518
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:26,009
My fingers on my right hand.

519
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:27,662
He cut them off.

520
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:30,710
Okay. Fuck off. Go. Go.

521
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:36,018
He? Who the fuck is he?
Tell me who he is right now.

522
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:40,240
I don't know. A fucking beekeeper.

523
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:43,330
<i>Makes honey and fucks with beehives.</i>

524
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:46,029
He fucks with beehives?
What's he saying about bees?

525
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,000
I don't know. He said he was, like,

526
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:49,898
protecting the hive or something.

527
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,793
Oh, fuck, man. What the...

528
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:53,508
Oh, Jesus Christ!

529
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:55,149
No, no, no! Bro, bro, bro!

530
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:56,696
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

531
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,896
You want money? You
want crypto? NFTs?

532
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,444
I got fucking NFTs.

533
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,172
What are you fucking... What?

534
00:37:02,197 --> 00:37:04,373
No! Dude, what the fuck is this, man?

535
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:08,779
Don't move.

536
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:12,023
I fucking can't move!

537
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,188
<i>You're fucking crazy, man.</i>

538
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:17,017
What the fuck, bro?

539
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,989
What the fuck! No, no,
no, no! No, no, no!

540
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,298
Fucking stop the fucking car! No! No!

541
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:55,882
Who do I have the
pleasure of speaking with?

542
00:37:58,566 --> 00:38:00,978
Fuck you. That's who.

543
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,420
You burned down my million-dollar

544
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:03,445
fucking call center.

545
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,979
Now I'm going to burn you down.

546
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:08,763
You haven't told me your name.

547
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,417
I told you my name.

548
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,555
It's fuck you. Mr. Fuck You.

549
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,874
You better fucking remember it.

550
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:14,204
<i>Because you don't burn me down.</i>

551
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:15,964
<i>I burn you down. You understand me?</i>

552
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,426
You are fucking with forces
that you cannot comprehend.

553
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,515
You sound young.

554
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,910
I bet you don't have estate planning.

555
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:25,931
I'm fucking 28 years old.
Why would I need that?

556
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,393
I'm about to show you.

557
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:48,258
<i>Breaking news in Springfield,</i>

558
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:49,936
<i>where three bodies
have been discovered</i>

559
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,310
<i>following an arson fire at a small farm.</i>

560
00:38:52,335 --> 00:38:54,205
<i>There was an office building explosion...</i>

561
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,508
- And you say one guy did this?
- Yup.

562
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:01,961
Killed seven armed men
without firing a shot.

563
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,141
Yup. And he said he was going to kill me.

564
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:07,402
And this is your

565
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:12,088
data mining consumer
service business, right?

566
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,656
Yes, something like that.

567
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,990
Pulling in 9 million a month in one office.

568
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:18,413
I've got, like, 20.

569
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:20,749
Yeah.

570
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,844
And the only thing you know about him

571
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:27,191
is he says he's a beekeeper.

572
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:30,177
Yeah, it's like his
whole brand or whatever.

573
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,527
Jesus.

574
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,591
What?

575
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:45,943
For someone who has elevated
fucking up into an art form,

576
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,699
this might well be your <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

577
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:52,520
How did I fuck up?

578
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:56,002
I don't know. You've done something.

579
00:39:56,953 --> 00:39:58,699
You've disturbed a Beekeeper.

580
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:00,222
Oh.

581
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:02,181
Oh, okay. So fucking what?

582
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,052
Why'd I care if the guy keeps bees?

583
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:06,315
If a Beekeeper says you're gonna die,

584
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:07,492
you're gonna die.

585
00:40:08,054 --> 00:40:10,974
There's nothing I can do
or anybody else to stop it.

586
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:16,124
So, like, what do you
even do here, then?

587
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:17,850
What good are you?

588
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:19,591
Yeah.

589
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:26,293
I did 35 years of loyal
government service,

590
00:40:27,002 --> 00:40:29,743
culminating as director of the world's

591
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:31,732
premier intelligence agency.

592
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:33,038
I could have done anything,

593
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,132
but I chose this job as
a favor to your mother.

594
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,817
I keep Danforth Enterprises safe.

595
00:40:40,484 --> 00:40:44,528
Keep her reputation safe, her name safe.

596
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,617
It's my fucking name too, all right?

597
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,445
Oh, sit down.

598
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,185
I put up with you.

599
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:51,796
I've put up with your tantrums,

600
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:55,218
kept you out of the tabloids,
kept you out of jail.

601
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,500
The endless stream of sex workers.

602
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,838
You're a drowning
man. Do you know that?

603
00:41:05,886 --> 00:41:07,017
Mm.

604
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:07,999
You're scared.

605
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:09,554
Dead right I'm scared.

606
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:13,472
Terrified. So should you be.

607
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:17,679
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

608
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:24,754
He's probably the last pair of eyes

609
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:26,359
that you're going to sneer at.

610
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,749
Okay, listen.

611
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,297
Remember our favorite burning building?

612
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:36,429
United Data Group.

613
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:38,421
The guys who work there are hackers,

614
00:41:38,446 --> 00:41:40,708
con men, fraudsters, et cetera, et cetera.

615
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:43,286
Guy who ran it. Garnett.

616
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:45,965
He's in the book. He's
a known mob associate.

617
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,078
He's missing, but I've
got PD chasing him down.

618
00:41:48,103 --> 00:41:50,714
Okay, so I had some
analysts run some shit,

619
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:52,940
and I think I'm starting to
get the shape of the animal.

620
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:55,545
Dude, I think United Data Group

621
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,266
is one of several call centers.

622
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:59,161
So there's got to be like a central office

623
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,448
that's controlling all of them,

624
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:01,968
and that's what we got to find.

625
00:42:01,993 --> 00:42:03,421
Wiley, this could be like

626
00:42:03,446 --> 00:42:05,405
a billion-dollar-a-year operation.

627
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:07,420
- Hello?
- Hey!

628
00:42:07,445 --> 00:42:09,272
Did you hear a single word I just said?

629
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:10,298
Yeah.

630
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,046
And?

631
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:15,765
I was just thinking you come in here,

632
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,138
hungover on your day off,

633
00:42:17,163 --> 00:42:18,642
and gain more yardage on this thing

634
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,321
than the whole squad has in two years.

635
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:24,203
Yeah, well, they fucked with my family.

636
00:42:25,939 --> 00:42:27,200
What'd you get on Clay?

637
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:28,695
- Your beekeeper?
- Yeah.

638
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,895
He's a ghost.

639
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,077
What?

640
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:33,842
Yeah, all I have is a birth certificate

641
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:35,030
and a social.

642
00:42:35,538 --> 00:42:37,162
The guy's never even -

643
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:38,250
had a bank account,

644
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,558
credit card, flown on a plane.

645
00:42:40,718 --> 00:42:42,733
I ran his prints through every database

646
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,344
I can think of, no hits.

647
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,468
That's bullshit.

648
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:48,344
This dude is former military all day.

649
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:50,436
No hits. I'm telling you.

650
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:51,611
Either he's never been printed,

651
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:54,310
or Adam Clay doesn't exist.

652
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,140
Which is terrifying to me

653
00:42:57,165 --> 00:42:59,079
because he's probably
in a classified program.

654
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:03,145
Special Agent Wiley.

655
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:06,249
Okay.

656
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:07,797
- Let's go.
- What?

657
00:43:07,822 --> 00:43:10,127
- They found the guy, Garnett.
- What?

658
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:12,198
- They found him. Let's go.
- Oh, shit.

659
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:16,429
Jessica.

660
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:18,094
<i>I think you know why I'm calling.</i>

661
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:21,224
You know, I'd do anything for you.

662
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:24,915
Anything for you.

663
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,051
Derek's scared shitless.

664
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:28,774
I've never seen him this scared.

665
00:43:29,195 --> 00:43:31,434
Well, he's made his bed.

666
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:34,409
I'll give you a board seat
on the holding company.

667
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:36,179
That's another million a year.

668
00:43:36,204 --> 00:43:38,640
<i>Plus you promised
you'd take care of him.</i>

669
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:42,693
Look, I don't need that. I have enough.

670
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:44,798
So you got this?

671
00:43:47,313 --> 00:43:49,141
Yeah. You have my word.

672
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,242
<i>Wallace...</i>

673
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:54,632
I still think of you...

674
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,671
<i>sometimes.</i>

675
00:43:57,898 --> 00:43:59,200
Sometimes.

676
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:16,546
Why are you calling me

677
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,045
on the "never call this line" line?

678
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:19,695
This is priority one, Janet.

679
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,764
Well, if it was priority
one, I would know about it.

680
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:23,616
Look, I'm heading
downtown to a POTUS brief.

681
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:24,662
<i>Just hear me out.</i>

682
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,648
Now, you know who I
work for, don't you?

683
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:28,717
<i>Oh, yeah. God help you, Wallace.</i>

684
00:44:28,742 --> 00:44:29,743
Exactly.

685
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:31,941
Well, Director Harward,

686
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:33,689
my young friend, seems to have caught

687
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,847
the unwanted attentions of...

688
00:44:36,538 --> 00:44:38,421
I don't know how else to say this.

689
00:44:38,446 --> 00:44:39,622
Of a Beekeeper.

690
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:44,178
Wait, a Beekeeper Beekeeper?

691
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:45,552
As in.

692
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:48,478
<i>- Well, that's not good.</i>
- No, it's not.

693
00:44:48,503 --> 00:44:51,332
- What's the body count?
<i>- Seven today.</i>

694
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,984
You busy making funeral arrangements?

695
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:57,359
I need help, Janet. Not jokes.

696
00:45:04,808 --> 00:45:05,929
Is that Garnett?

697
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,009
He was strapped to an old pickup.

698
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:10,054
Check this out.

699
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:29,901
Does this mean you've
taken pity on an old man?

700
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:34,383
So your problem? He's
retired from the program.

701
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:36,390
No longer active.

702
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,738
Well, that changes everything.

703
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,662
The current active Beekeeper
is aware of the issue

704
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,383
and is going to be
taking things from here.

705
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:47,061
You can rest easy, old friend.

706
00:45:47,086 --> 00:45:48,348
<i>Oh, no. Janet.</i>

707
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:51,312
The current active Beekeeper
is a fucking lunatic

708
00:45:51,337 --> 00:45:53,382
<i>who should have been
removed months ago.</i>

709
00:45:53,407 --> 00:45:54,929
God help us now.

710
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,374
Get out of here!

711
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,281
Shit!

712
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:46,543
- Excuse me.
- You're cool.

713
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:08,868
You've been a busy bee.

714
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,739
You're supposed to be retired.

715
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,612
I'm assuming you're my replacement.

716
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,522
Fuck you!

717
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:41,396
I need your keys.

718
00:48:57,128 --> 00:48:58,564
There's an issue.

719
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:00,938
The problem has not been solved.

720
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:03,462
Well...

721
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:07,031
That is a surprise.

722
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:09,815
The Beekeepers have
studied the situation

723
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:12,148
and have decided to remain neutral.

724
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:14,254
How can they do that?

725
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:16,257
He was their man, for fuck's sake!

726
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:18,216
<i>I'm sorry, Wallace.</i>

727
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:20,479
You're on your own.

728
00:49:23,432 --> 00:49:25,216
I thought you could fucking handle this.

729
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:26,807
I can handle this!

730
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:41,500
Thank you.

731
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,111
What you got for us, Detective?

732
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,199
That's her vehicle,

733
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,549
registered to a Anisette Landress.

734
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,813
The ATF are en route
inbound to take care of it.

735
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:53,512
We're way cooler than ATF.

736
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,890
I'll show you why I called them.

737
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:03,956
That's a Minigun.

738
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:06,065
They use those on military vehicles.

739
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,657
Did you know that puppy
shoots 6,000 rounds a minute?

740
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:10,658
I know.

741
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:12,357
Did you know that's
100 rounds a second?

742
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,011
Yep, I know.

743
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:17,013
Did you know that you know a lot?

744
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,492
Yes, I do.

745
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:19,446
It's because I minored in math.

746
00:50:19,471 --> 00:50:20,994
I'm a pretty smart guy actually.

747
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,243
Okay, then, do you know
who Anisette Landress is?

748
00:50:23,268 --> 00:50:25,182
- Yes, I do.
- Go ahead and tell me.

749
00:50:25,207 --> 00:50:27,034
Someone who doesn't exist

750
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,373
in any commercial or
government database.

751
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:30,722
Someone who's a ghost.

752
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:33,030
Like our good friend Adam Clay.

753
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,821
<i>"Beekeeping for Beekeepers."</i>

754
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:40,384
Here's another reason

755
00:50:40,385 --> 00:50:41,540
that Anisette Landress

756
00:50:41,565 --> 00:50:43,170
is like our good friend Adam Clay.

757
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:47,044
Do you know what's that way?

758
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,899
Springfield...

759
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:52,571
where the call center was torched.

760
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,899
And that way where
Adam Clay's headed?

761
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:58,707
Boston.

762
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:00,965
Let's go.

763
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:03,946
Thank you.

764
00:51:19,064 --> 00:51:20,282
How are you, my friend?

765
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:22,221
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you.

766
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:24,245
Yeah, come on,

767
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,759
leave them alone. Leave them alone.

768
00:51:25,784 --> 00:51:27,735
Don't play with those things. They go off.

769
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:29,347
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

770
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:34,830
When I was sworn in as director,

771
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:39,269
I was read into programs
I never imagined existed.

772
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:42,621
Well...

773
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:48,844
there are programs
even I wasn't privy to.

774
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:52,021
Like the Beekeepers.

775
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:57,025
The honeybee has always

776
00:51:57,026 --> 00:51:59,115
had a special relationship with humanity.

777
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,639
A sacred relationship.

778
00:52:01,553 --> 00:52:04,250
Why? No bees, no agriculture.

779
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:06,427
No agriculture, no civilization.

780
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:10,735
Our nation is not unlike a beehive,

781
00:52:10,736 --> 00:52:13,912
with its complex systems of workers,

782
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:15,914
caretakers, even royalty.

783
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:20,048
If any of the beehive's
complex mechanisms

784
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:21,896
are compromised,

785
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:24,597
the hive collapses.

786
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,186
Someone a long time ago decided

787
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:29,406
that a mechanism was needed

788
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:30,800
to keep our nation safe.

789
00:52:30,825 --> 00:52:33,453
A mechanism outside
the chain of command,

790
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:36,659
outside the system.

791
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:41,941
Its one mission, to keep the system safe.

792
00:52:42,594 --> 00:52:45,683
Beekeepers are given all resources,

793
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:49,904
empowered to act on
their own judgment.

794
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:52,385
For decades, they have quietly worked

795
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:54,649
to keep the hive safe.

796
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:58,044
That is, until now.

797
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:02,265
It appears that a retired Beekeeper

798
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,657
has gone off program

799
00:53:03,658 --> 00:53:06,456
and is acting in what
he mistakenly believes

800
00:53:06,481 --> 00:53:08,875
is the hive's best interest.

801
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:11,160
Can't somebody just pick up the phone

802
00:53:11,185 --> 00:53:13,316
and tell this yahoo to
stand-the-fuck down?

803
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:15,560
That's the one thing
Beekeepers don't do.

804
00:53:15,888 --> 00:53:17,281
Stand down.

805
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:19,847
Not unlike bees themselves,

806
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:23,460
Beekeepers keep working until they die.

807
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:25,244
So he's basically one of us.

808
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:28,334
No. He's not like you.

809
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:30,032
You're tier one operators,

810
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:33,210
former SEAL Team Six, Delta Group.

811
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:38,388
You are, in other words, pussies.

812
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:40,477
If you were in the same room,

813
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:41,609
he would kill you.

814
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,613
With enough of you, then
maybe you just might

815
00:53:46,614 --> 00:53:49,094
in fact be able to kill him

816
00:53:49,095 --> 00:53:51,270
before he accomplishes his goal.

817
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:52,620
What would that be?

818
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,190
To kill his way to the top of the hive.

819
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,804
Mr. Pettis, you should
get your people moving.

820
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,466
Dude, bees are interesting little shits.

821
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:14,761
Did you know that?

822
00:54:14,786 --> 00:54:16,948
I know they pollinate a bunch of shit

823
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:18,341
and we'd be fucked without them.

824
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:19,342
Listen.

825
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,518
"Some bees are queen slayers,"

826
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,084
"which will rise up and kill their queen"

827
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:24,276
"if she fails to produce"

828
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:26,573
"the right kind of male offspring."

829
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:28,699
Fascinating.

830
00:54:29,918 --> 00:54:31,919
- No.
- Hm. Nope.

831
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,144
- No.
- No!

832
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,769
- It's your turn. You can't...
- No!

833
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:43,018
Special Agent Parker.

834
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:46,253
Yeah.

835
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:48,022
Okay.

836
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:49,024
Thank you.

837
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,725
What?

838
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,642
The deputy director is
flying up from DC to see us.

839
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,855
Oh, fuck. This is your fault.

840
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:37,784
Here's another interesting factoid.

841
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,133
Thank fuck.

842
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:41,179
You know, I was getting sick of enjoying

843
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,620
my peaceful thoughts.

844
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:46,967
Sir.

845
00:56:46,968 --> 00:56:48,621
Sir, this is Special Agent Parker,

846
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:49,883
Special Agent Wiley.

847
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:51,407
They'll be briefing you.

848
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,843
This is Deputy Director Prigg

849
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:55,280
and Amanda Munoz, special counsel.

850
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:57,089
Mr. Deputy Director,

851
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:58,849
my colleague and I believe

852
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,894
that three major crime
scenes in our area

853
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:02,809
are connected to a single subject.

854
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:03,897
Adam Clay.

855
00:57:03,898 --> 00:57:05,377
He killed six people today.

856
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:08,075
Based on the extensive use of trade craft

857
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:10,184
and the nature of his alias,

858
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,688
we believe that Mr. Clay is connected

859
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:14,082
to a classified program
named Beekeeper.

860
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:16,867
A program that none of
our partner agencies

861
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:18,043
seem willing to acknowledge.

862
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,482
Let's stick to what we
know, Special Agent Parker.

863
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,491
Yes, sir.

864
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:25,537
In any event, this
individual is highly capable

865
00:57:25,562 --> 00:57:27,229
and extremely motivated,

866
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:29,255
and we believe that he's
on his way to Boston,

867
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,672
if not already here.

868
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,786
And we believe that
this is his next target,

869
00:57:33,811 --> 00:57:35,333
Nine Star United,

870
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:36,987
which appears to be the entity

871
00:57:37,012 --> 00:57:38,578
operating the regional call centers,

872
00:57:38,603 --> 00:57:40,431
like the one that Mr. Clay burned down.

873
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:43,460
Why is Adam Clay on this rampage?

874
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:48,769
He's, um, protecting the hive, sir.

875
00:57:49,422 --> 00:57:50,684
It's what Beekeepers do.

876
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:52,925
I have enough to brief the director.

877
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:55,514
- What's your ask?
- My ask?

878
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:59,189
Uh, well, a SWAT team, for starters.

879
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:01,826
Surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

880
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:04,045
That shouldn't be a problem.

881
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:05,438
Thank you.

882
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:15,317
- Did that just happen?
- Yeah.

883
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:23,455
All right. Everybody, listen up.

884
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:24,717
It's roll call time.

885
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:27,067
I'm getting ready for my dick to get hard

886
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:29,766
with some wonderful, beautiful numbers.

887
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:31,681
Let's start with Phoenix. Where we at?

888
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:33,770
Phoenix is up 201K.

889
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:36,163
200K, I'm gonna suck
your dick. I love you.

890
00:58:36,164 --> 00:58:38,035
New Orleans, show me,

891
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:39,602
tell me. Where we at?

892
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:40,994
It's down 93K, boss.

893
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,996
Down? You're a fucking loser.

894
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,511
You give me a fucking headache.

895
00:58:44,536 --> 00:58:45,892
You give me fucking cancer.

896
00:58:45,917 --> 00:58:48,001
New York, make me happy. I beg you.

897
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:51,050
New York City's up 64 ASCOT.

898
00:58:51,075 --> 00:58:53,686
Yeah! I love you, New York!

899
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:02,581
Gather around!

900
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:04,452
I want all weapons front on entry.

901
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:06,150
- Everybody give me an oos!
- Oos!

902
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:07,238
Let's go!

903
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:15,246
Power down, my federal
friend. Power down.

904
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:17,509
Private security here on
the orders of the Governor.

905
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,511
State Department
certified to carry weapons

906
00:59:19,512 --> 00:59:20,600
in all 50 states.

907
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,689
Feel free to call the highlighted numbers

908
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:24,822
to verify.

909
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:27,607
You're not welcome
here. Get the fuck out.

910
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:30,392
All right, boys, let's go!

911
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:34,571
Set up a perimeter outside.

912
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:37,790
Your goals, they mean bonuses.

913
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:40,190
Money, money, money,
we fucking love it.

914
00:59:41,226 --> 00:59:43,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the fuck?

915
00:59:43,442 --> 00:59:45,530
Who the fuck are you?
You can't be in here.

916
00:59:45,555 --> 00:59:47,382
We're the guys keeping you alive.

917
00:59:47,407 --> 00:59:48,799
Shut it down now.

918
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:50,455
Everybody, listen up.

919
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:51,855
Anyone who's not carrying a weapon,

920
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,401
get the fuck out!

921
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:54,915
Shouldn't you be killing
bin Laden or something?

922
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:58,637
Listen to me, my friend.
This place prints money.

923
00:59:58,638 --> 01:00:00,421
No one's shutting down.

924
01:00:00,422 --> 01:00:03,861
Anybody so much as puts a
phone down, they're fired!

925
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:06,075
I'm sorry to break it to you,

926
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,666
but bin Laden's been dead for a while.

927
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,996
So I'm going to say this one last time.

928
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:11,259
Shut it down.

929
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:13,706
The fuck I am.

930
01:00:14,132 --> 01:00:16,176
Call your fucking boss.

931
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:17,776
You want me to call my boss?

932
01:00:18,551 --> 01:00:19,595
I'll do that.

933
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:24,490
And you'll be so fucked,
it's gonna be beautiful.

934
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:27,852
Don't be shy. Come on.

935
01:00:28,973 --> 01:00:30,756
What about the parking garage?

936
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:32,671
Closed and locked. Steel gate.

937
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:34,532
I want a body on comms watching it.

938
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:36,762
- Delivery dock?
- Same deal.

939
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,721
- Station an agent there too.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,853
Sure there's no back
entrances into this place?

941
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,333
Hey, there're no other entrances.

942
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,640
Federal law enforcement
operation in progress.

943
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,902
Move along at a minimum retreat

944
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:47,338
to a safe distance. Thank you.

945
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:48,774
Someone scout the service tunnel.

946
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:51,690
The other option, instead of going in

947
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,039
is to smoke them out.

948
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,345
Excuse me?

949
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:56,540
I figured I'd give the firefighters a break.

950
01:00:57,479 --> 01:00:59,176
I've put them through enough already.

951
01:00:59,177 --> 01:01:00,743
What'd you say your name was?

952
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:02,354
Currently I go by Adam Clay.

953
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:04,964
Trust me, if there was a back entrance,

954
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,226
I would've used it.

955
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:07,706
I don't want to injure anyone

956
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:08,987
who's innocent and non-involved.

957
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:11,493
But it is what it is.

958
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:13,625
Somebody detain this guy!

959
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:41,453
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

960
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:53,665
Oh, wow, if it isn't the fucking

961
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,058
golden goose himself.

962
01:01:55,059 --> 01:01:56,755
Sir, I got Captain Caveman here

963
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:58,809
telling me to send everyone home.

964
01:01:58,834 --> 01:01:59,582
If we do that,

965
01:01:59,607 --> 01:02:01,717
we're walking away from a lot of money.

966
01:02:01,874 --> 01:02:03,440
Mm. Put him on.

967
01:02:04,615 --> 01:02:05,660
It's for you.

968
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:09,028
Why are you fucking with my business?

969
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,813
Because Mr. Westwyld hired me

970
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,859
to kick some fucking Beekeeper's ass.

971
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,774
Mr. Westwyld works for me,

972
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:18,356
which means that you work for me.

973
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:19,759
Now, listen, that place

974
01:02:19,784 --> 01:02:22,215
is the crown jewel of my kingdom.

975
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:23,913
I'm not gonna let
some crash test dummy

976
01:02:23,914 --> 01:02:25,305
with a fucking gun fuck it up.

977
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:26,793
Is that clear, Mr. Pettis?

978
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:28,308
Didn't this character already burn

979
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:29,788
one of your centers to the ground?

980
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:31,659
Well, you know, they didn't have you,

981
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,922
and that's why.

982
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:35,098
So maybe you just do your fucking job

983
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:37,230
and don't tell me how to do mine, please.

984
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:39,316
<i>- We got it?</i>
- Copy that.

985
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:43,715
Fall out. Set up a perimeter outside.

986
01:02:43,716 --> 01:02:45,151
Let's go. Move!

987
01:02:45,152 --> 01:02:46,793
Round of applause.

988
01:02:46,818 --> 01:02:48,732
Let's say goodbye to our good friends.

989
01:02:48,757 --> 01:02:52,308
Bye-bye, Admiral. Go
join fucking Space Force.

990
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:55,814
You are beautiful. Now get the fuck out!

991
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:57,250
Keep walking.

992
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:58,775
Bye-bye, dickhead.

993
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:02,473
What a bunch of jackoffs.

994
01:03:02,474 --> 01:03:04,171
Yeah, we love you!

995
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:16,574
One time amnesty.

996
01:03:16,575 --> 01:03:18,184
Whoever doesn't want
to die this evening,

997
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:21,807
can in an orderly fashion leave now.

998
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:24,245
Uh, uh, uh. No fucking
way. It's not happening.

999
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:25,801
Anybody moves, you're fired.

1000
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,194
- No bonus, vesting, two weeks.
- Come on, boys! Move, move!

1001
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:29,283
Nada. Zero!

1002
01:03:30,048 --> 01:03:31,701
Are you fucking nuts?

1003
01:03:31,726 --> 01:03:33,324
Each one of these pricks is worth

1004
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:35,448
30 to 40 million a year in profit.

1005
01:03:35,473 --> 01:03:38,180
So no one is shooting no guns.

1006
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,685
Not a good day to drag
innocent people into this.

1007
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:42,600
These assholes? They're not innocent.

1008
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:44,820
For either one of us
to close that distance,

1009
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,517
some of them will get hurt.

1010
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:48,346
Let's start with this prick right here.

1011
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:04,449
On me!

1012
01:04:13,545 --> 01:04:14,676
Take right!

1013
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:31,389
Pettis, we got a man down.

1014
01:04:53,231 --> 01:04:55,043
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1015
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,522
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1016
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:07,074
You know who you're working for?

1017
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:09,079
None of my fucking business.

1018
01:05:09,104 --> 01:05:11,106
I'm just the guy they call
when there's a problem.

1019
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,135
And you are our problem.

1020
01:05:17,626 --> 01:05:19,497
Goddamn right, I'm a problem.

1021
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,375
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1022
01:05:46,507 --> 01:05:48,421
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1023
01:05:58,476 --> 01:06:00,202
Dan, what the hell happened?

1024
01:06:00,531 --> 01:06:01,706
Any dead?

1025
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:03,557
Not dead, but we got our asses kicked.

1026
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:06,309
- Our guy. What do we know?
- He's in the building.

1027
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,702
I'm waiting more men to roll in.

1028
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:09,573
I don't know what this guy is,

1029
01:06:09,574 --> 01:06:11,096
but nobody can do what he's done.

1030
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:12,925
He's just a Beekeeper.

1031
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:15,406
Bad idea.

1032
01:06:16,937 --> 01:06:18,068
I'm not waiting.

1033
01:06:18,093 --> 01:06:19,397
- V, wait!
- Move!

1034
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:20,772
Come on, Wiley, keep up.

1035
01:06:21,238 --> 01:06:22,326
Fuck.

1036
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:36,993
We got him!

1037
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,962
- You done?
- Reload.

1038
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:57,399
Everybody out!

1039
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:10,428
You're done.

1040
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:28,835
We should take the stairs.

1041
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,046
Smart.

1042
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:32,918
<i>Subject is in the hallway.</i>

1043
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:36,704
<i>Command, report back.
Anybody on comm?</i>

1044
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:49,847
Please, please don't kill me.

1045
01:07:49,848 --> 01:07:53,243
I'm just a middle manager.
I never hurt nobody.

1046
01:07:53,852 --> 01:07:55,505
I'd respect you more if you look people

1047
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:57,508
in their eyes when you steal from them.

1048
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,541
Now, you're making a lot of money here.

1049
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,932
Tell me where it's all going.

1050
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,376
I don't know, man.

1051
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:21,211
I know you're the middle man.

1052
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:25,304
- Who's above you?
- No. They'll kill me.

1053
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:30,931
I'll torture you, then kill you.

1054
01:08:36,543 --> 01:08:37,935
Come on, guys. You got it.

1055
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,222
Wiley, get your ass up here!

1056
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:43,161
Yeah, well, I'm not an Olympian.

1057
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,624
Make it stop.

1058
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:46,616
You can make it stop.

1059
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,602
You've stolen hundreds of millions

1060
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:50,908
from people who've done nothing

1061
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:52,302
but work hard all their lives.

1062
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:59,466
She was an educator, a mom.

1063
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:01,754
Dedicated her whole
life to helping people.

1064
01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:05,866
Yesterday, she shot herself

1065
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:09,449
because you took two million
from a charity she ran.

1066
01:09:14,933 --> 01:09:17,196
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

1067
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,780
Who and where, Mr. Anzalone?

1068
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:26,335
- Tell me who and where.
- I can't.

1069
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:27,553
Look, these people,

1070
01:09:27,554 --> 01:09:29,061
they're untouchable. I can't...

1071
01:09:29,086 --> 01:09:31,654
No, please! Please! Stop! I will! I will!

1072
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:34,327
Let me show you. Let me show you.

1073
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:54,190
I told you they were untouchable.

1074
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,764
Nobody's untouchable.

1075
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,882
Sometimes when the
hive's out of balance...

1076
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,835
you have to replace the queen.

1077
01:10:13,349 --> 01:10:14,538
Clay!

1078
01:10:17,648 --> 01:10:19,562
That man is directly responsible

1079
01:10:19,563 --> 01:10:20,952
for your mother's death.

1080
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:25,569
I believe you.

1081
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:28,441
But we have laws for these things.

1082
01:10:31,444 --> 01:10:33,838
You have laws for these
things until they fail.

1083
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:37,102
Then you have me.

1084
01:10:47,315 --> 01:10:48,664
Arrest him!

1085
01:10:48,835 --> 01:10:51,246
On your feet before I blow
your fucking head off.

1086
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,291
I just been thrown through
a plate glass window.

1087
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,380
Shut your fucking mouth!

1088
01:11:07,818 --> 01:11:09,820
Whoa. I have four kids.

1089
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:14,319
I know. Three boys and a girl.

1090
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:28,848
Wiley? You okay?

1091
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,720
- Yeah. He went that way.
- You okay?

1092
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:32,112
- Have you been hit?
- My wife thinks

1093
01:11:32,113 --> 01:11:33,418
I'm doing computer nerd shit.

1094
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:34,617
Well, I won't tell her if you don't.

1095
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:36,247
- Have you been hit?
- No, I'm good, Mom.

1096
01:11:36,248 --> 01:11:37,509
Did you get him?

1097
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:39,337
- Did you?
- No, he's tricky.

1098
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:41,034
- Get up. You okay?
- Almost, but...

1099
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:42,558
I guess that's just evidence.

1100
01:11:42,559 --> 01:11:44,843
- Can I borrow your gun?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1101
01:11:44,868 --> 01:11:46,897
- On me. On me. On me. On me.
- Clear!

1102
01:11:54,498 --> 01:11:56,282
I want interviews with all of them.

1103
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:03,975
We're going to talk.

1104
01:12:04,624 --> 01:12:05,858
Get him out of here.

1105
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:24,470
Wiley.

1106
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:33,131
Holy shit.

1107
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,751
Do you mind if I ask you

1108
01:12:45,776 --> 01:12:47,350
a really boring question?

1109
01:12:47,624 --> 01:12:50,280
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

1110
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:51,801
Mm.

1111
01:12:51,802 --> 01:12:53,073
That's deep.

1112
01:12:53,098 --> 01:12:55,258
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

1113
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:59,548
Oh, God. Uh...

1114
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:01,551
Would you excuse me for
a moment? Come upstairs.

1115
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:08,295
<i>You said these guys were
the fucking best. Uh...</i>

1116
01:13:08,296 --> 01:13:09,341
Why are they all dead?

1117
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,791
You kicked the beehive

1118
01:13:11,816 --> 01:13:13,992
and now we have to reap the whirlwind.

1119
01:13:16,249 --> 01:13:18,425
- Unless...
- Unless.

1120
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,546
Unless, unless, unless fucking what?

1121
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:23,659
Maybe now is the time
to call your mother.

1122
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,004
I'm paying you so much fucking money

1123
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,772
and your advice is to call my mother?

1124
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:33,451
He can't make his move on us

1125
01:13:33,452 --> 01:13:36,278
if we're in her proximity, can he?

1126
01:13:36,303 --> 01:13:37,456
Her people.

1127
01:13:44,768 --> 01:13:46,046
You're a fuck.

1128
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,015
- You're scared...
- I certainly am scared.

1129
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:49,511
And you want to use my mother

1130
01:13:49,512 --> 01:13:50,686
as a human shield.

1131
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:52,776
Just call her. Just call her. Come on.

1132
01:13:53,646 --> 01:13:55,342
It's not a game now.

1133
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:56,655
Oh, it's all a game.

1134
01:13:56,954 --> 01:13:58,303
Come on.

1135
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:00,783
Yes, Derek. What do you want?

1136
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:02,785
<i>Hey, Mom. No, nothing.</i>

1137
01:14:02,786 --> 01:14:04,613
<i>I was just, you know, thinking about you.</i>

1138
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:07,514
<i>I miss you. I was hoping to
maybe see you this weekend.</i>

1139
01:14:07,795 --> 01:14:09,143
I'm at the beach house.

1140
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:10,780
You're welcome to join if you behave.

1141
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:13,360
<i>I would love to. And, hey,
I actually was going to,</i>

1142
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:14,664
<i>you know, get together with some of my</i>

1143
01:14:14,688 --> 01:14:16,146
<i>tech homies and stuff, if that's, uh,</i>

1144
01:14:16,147 --> 01:14:17,582
<i>if that's cool with you.</i>

1145
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,061
Fine. No drugs.

1146
01:14:19,086 --> 01:14:21,241
Give Kelly the details.
Love you. Have to go.

1147
01:14:22,477 --> 01:14:23,825
Derek's joining me this weekend.

1148
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,111
Help me keep him sober.

1149
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:26,549
Yes, ma'am. I love babysitting.

1150
01:14:27,114 --> 01:14:28,941
Madame President, Funmi Lawal.

1151
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:30,682
Hello. Good to meet you.

1152
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:31,905
Sola Oyemade.

1153
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:33,409
Sola, thank you so much for coming.

1154
01:14:33,434 --> 01:14:34,725
Susan Aneno.

1155
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,490
Thank you so much for
coming all this way.

1156
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:37,647
Oli Ray-Imanuel.

1157
01:14:37,672 --> 01:14:39,872
- Oli, how good to meet you.
- Great to meet you, ma'am.

1158
01:14:47,004 --> 01:14:49,077
You don't have to do this, you know?

1159
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:52,350
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1160
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:56,733
Your mom is dead
because of these people.

1161
01:15:04,848 --> 01:15:06,218
Wherever it's headed...

1162
01:15:07,851 --> 01:15:08,939
I swore an oath.

1163
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:12,420
I can't stand by and watch it happen.

1164
01:15:19,732 --> 01:15:20,907
Even if he's right?

1165
01:15:27,218 --> 01:15:28,306
Even if he's right.

1166
01:15:31,004 --> 01:15:33,702
<i>Apologies. Damn plane was delayed.</i>

1167
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:34,843
<i>What have you got?</i>

1168
01:15:35,269 --> 01:15:38,533
We think we have a sense of
Mr. Clay's true intentions.

1169
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,927
He seems to be following the money.

1170
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:43,234
<i>What money is that?</i>

1171
01:15:43,756 --> 01:15:46,932
Usually it's from people
with no heirs, no family.

1172
01:15:46,933 --> 01:15:49,587
Nine Star United uses
data mining software

1173
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:53,349
to identify these people and
then target their assets.

1174
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:56,220
There's another company involved, sir,

1175
01:15:56,245 --> 01:15:58,988
a company who is a vendor to
the intelligence community

1176
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:00,380
and to the Justice Department.

1177
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:02,513
In fact, we use this company's software

1178
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:04,123
in this very office

1179
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:06,692
to identify financial fraud.

1180
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,673
<i>Are you going to tell me
the name of this company?</i>

1181
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:18,355
Danforth Enterprises.

1182
01:16:18,356 --> 01:16:21,706
With an annual revenue of $10 billion,

1183
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:25,754
founded and operated
by Jessica Danforth,

1184
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:28,234
who recently stepped down
because she was sworn in

1185
01:16:28,235 --> 01:16:31,300
as President of the United States.

1186
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:33,152
<i>She self-financed her campaign.</i>

1187
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:35,852
Yeah. None of that money was clean.

1188
01:16:36,243 --> 01:16:37,505
<i>Who else knows this?</i>

1189
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:40,290
Us three.

1190
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:42,814
I have a really bad memory, sir.

1191
01:16:42,815 --> 01:16:45,817
<i>Let's, uh, keep the circle small,</i>

1192
01:16:45,818 --> 01:16:48,080
<i>until I can brief the director
and the attorney general.</i>

1193
01:16:48,081 --> 01:16:50,082
<i>Not a word of this to
anyone. Understood?</i>

1194
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,111
Yes, sir.

1195
01:16:51,136 --> 01:16:53,042
<i>And, Mr. Clay, I see his kill count</i>

1196
01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:54,609
<i>is steadily rising.</i>

1197
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,914
In a beehive, there is something

1198
01:16:55,915 --> 01:16:57,395
called a "queen slayer."

1199
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:01,461
It's a bee that will rise
up and kill the queen

1200
01:17:01,486 --> 01:17:04,096
if she produces defective offspring.

1201
01:17:04,097 --> 01:17:06,533
<i>I thought we were sticking
to the known knowns.</i>

1202
01:17:07,017 --> 01:17:09,580
Right. Yes. Not that Beekeepers exist.

1203
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:12,583
But Mr. Clay does keep honey bees.

1204
01:17:12,584 --> 01:17:14,672
He admires their willingness

1205
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:17,328
to sacrifice themselves
for the greater good.

1206
01:17:18,938 --> 01:17:22,855
Our concern is that Clay
believes that Derek Danforth

1207
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:25,641
is the defective offspring of a queen,

1208
01:17:26,293 --> 01:17:29,295
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1209
01:17:29,296 --> 01:17:31,516
and become a queen slayer.

1210
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:36,739
<i>Adam Clay's next victim is
Derek Danforth's mother?</i>

1211
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:39,742
President Danforth, sir.

1212
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:43,072
<i>You have a blank check. Good luck.</i>

1213
01:17:44,703 --> 01:17:45,878
Thank you.

1214
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:03,808
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is a private event.

1215
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:06,028
I'm gonna need you to
turn around, go away.

1216
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:07,899
Federal Bureau of something or another.

1217
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,553
We're good. We have invites right here.

1218
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:11,250
All right. You'll need
to excuse my partner.

1219
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:12,940
He's recently concussed and
hasn't slept in two days.

1220
01:18:12,964 --> 01:18:14,197
We're on the access list.

1221
01:18:15,216 --> 01:18:16,517
We're good, boss.

1222
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:46,721
Get the Secret Service out of the house.

1223
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:47,896
I don't want them here.

1224
01:18:47,897 --> 01:18:50,483
They're C team. B team at best.

1225
01:18:50,508 --> 01:18:53,118
Uh, Mom's detail is not going to like that.

1226
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:55,860
Well, if Mom's detail gets in the way

1227
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:56,992
of what's coming for us,

1228
01:18:56,993 --> 01:18:58,986
they're dead men and so are we.

1229
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:01,997
Tell them they can stay in the kitchen.

1230
01:19:01,998 --> 01:19:02,998
Yes, sir.

1231
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:09,787
He has a little talent, doesn't he?

1232
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:11,267
He's absolutely fucking terrifying.

1233
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:12,462
Yeah.

1234
01:19:12,487 --> 01:19:14,855
Good men, but clearly not good enough.

1235
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,794
- Hm.
- Fuck, bruh!

1236
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:18,796
How'd you piss this oak off, huh?

1237
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:20,025
I...

1238
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,930
- You're looking at me?
- Mm-hmm.

1239
01:19:21,931 --> 01:19:24,169
How is any of this my fault?

1240
01:19:24,194 --> 01:19:26,151
Wasn't your super-secret CIA

1241
01:19:26,152 --> 01:19:27,762
data mining software supposed to,

1242
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,024
I don't know, maybe filter out

1243
01:19:29,025 --> 01:19:30,518
un-fucking-stoppable killing machines?

1244
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:32,244
Don't you fuck with me, young man!

1245
01:19:32,245 --> 01:19:34,029
Any other life, you'd be in jail.

1246
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,554
Hey, this is the fucking Beekeeper!

1247
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:42,167
Yeah, you know I killed one once.

1248
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:43,473
Oh, you see?

1249
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:45,692
Yeah. Only 'cause I was lucky.

1250
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:48,305
- And un-fucking-lucky.
- Oh, jeez.

1251
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:53,265
Yeah, don't piss your pants, bruh.

1252
01:19:53,266 --> 01:19:55,069
My team will be out shortly.

1253
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:56,442
If anyone can knock

1254
01:19:56,443 --> 01:19:58,270
this guy's dick in the dirt, it's them.

1255
01:19:58,271 --> 01:20:01,095
Ain't that right, money man?

1256
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:04,204
Yeah.

1257
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:21,728
I'm supposed to be at
a kids' birthday party

1258
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:22,986
with my wife.

1259
01:20:26,778 --> 01:20:28,648
You are at a kids' birthday party.

1260
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:30,282
And I'm your work wife.

1261
01:20:45,057 --> 01:20:47,711
Madam President, you look spectacular.

1262
01:20:47,712 --> 01:20:49,234
When the fuck are you going to tell me

1263
01:20:49,235 --> 01:20:50,884
what's going on, Wallace?

1264
01:20:54,327 --> 01:20:55,807
Good. Go through.

1265
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:58,983
Tell that guy to hurry up.

1266
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:01,812
I want every manhole on
this street welded shut.

1267
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:11,910
Six up.

1268
01:21:12,878 --> 01:21:13,923
Good to go.

1269
01:21:15,174 --> 01:21:16,480
Let's go. Let's go.

1270
01:21:28,579 --> 01:21:30,320
Come on. Move it up.

1271
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:49,197
Put your head on a swivel, gentlemen.

1272
01:22:05,489 --> 01:22:06,490
Go!

1273
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:36,386
We got eyes on the second floor.

1274
01:22:43,828 --> 01:22:45,786
All right, you're good. Coming through.

1275
01:23:09,549 --> 01:23:11,028
Oh.

1276
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:14,423
Hey. When, uh, did you
get in? What a surprise.

1277
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:18,514
You didn't hear the
giant Marine helicopter

1278
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:20,535
land on the front lawn?

1279
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,518
Ah, I guess not. Hm.

1280
01:23:22,519 --> 01:23:24,737
Is this, uh, nicotine or a carnival ride?

1281
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:27,349
Uh, I wouldn't unless you want to go

1282
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:28,954
talk with the machine elves.

1283
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,965
Hey, you look fucking great, by the way.

1284
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:38,243
I mean, power, it just
looks so good on you.

1285
01:23:38,274 --> 01:23:40,579
Doing blow on your father's desk.

1286
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,364
God, how I wish he was still alive

1287
01:23:42,365 --> 01:23:44,149
so I could kill him.

1288
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:48,240
Stop picking your face.

1289
01:23:51,156 --> 01:23:53,940
Why does Wallace Westwyld
look nervous as a burning cat?

1290
01:23:53,941 --> 01:23:55,247
What have you done to the man?

1291
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:58,267
Mm, I wouldn't know, Mother.

1292
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,425
Well, he's there to protect you

1293
01:24:00,426 --> 01:24:01,743
if you'll let him.

1294
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:07,780
You're a good looking kid.
You really are. You know that?

1295
01:24:09,434 --> 01:24:10,579
What does that mean?

1296
01:24:12,395 --> 01:24:16,180
It means that God doesn't
give with both hands.

1297
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:18,443
Uh, okay. I love you too, Mom.

1298
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:20,054
Hm.

1299
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,032
Gotta go run the free world.

1300
01:24:22,405 --> 01:24:23,814
Don't burn it down.

1301
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,109
Fucking fantastic!

1302
01:25:39,612 --> 01:25:41,132
Wiley, look.

1303
01:25:42,224 --> 01:25:44,009
Oh, shit.

1304
01:25:44,034 --> 01:25:46,055
Danforth looks like
she wants to throw up.

1305
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,621
Look at her body language. Bad vibes.

1306
01:25:49,868 --> 01:25:51,363
She got caught riding dirty.

1307
01:25:52,799 --> 01:25:54,105
What have we done?

1308
01:25:54,798 --> 01:25:57,087
Are you, uh, fucking with
crypto at all, right now?

1309
01:25:57,112 --> 01:25:58,134
It's gonna pop.

1310
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,914
They're minting next week,
so just hit me up on Insta.

1311
01:26:00,939 --> 01:26:02,736
- Okay.
- I'll connect your wallet.

1312
01:26:02,761 --> 01:26:04,544
- May I borrow my son?
- Of course.

1313
01:26:04,569 --> 01:26:06,117
Speak to you a moment in private?

1314
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:09,251
Sorry.

1315
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:13,556
Uh, who's this?

1316
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:15,841
Jackson Prigg. He's
number two at the FBI.

1317
01:26:15,866 --> 01:26:17,214
Have a seat.

1318
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:18,911
Uh, I'm cool. I'll stand. What is this, like,

1319
01:26:18,912 --> 01:26:20,783
an ambush or something? This
feels weird. I don't like it.

1320
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:22,089
No, you'll sit.

1321
01:26:25,275 --> 01:26:26,450
I'll sit.

1322
01:26:30,236 --> 01:26:31,576
Kelly, would you give us a moment?

1323
01:26:31,577 --> 01:26:33,187
It's okay, ma'am. I can take notes.

1324
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,667
I need you to step outside.

1325
01:26:43,112 --> 01:26:46,114
The deputy director has
flagged his, uh, concerns

1326
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:47,617
about some uncomfortable things

1327
01:26:47,642 --> 01:26:49,166
happening inside the family company.

1328
01:26:49,832 --> 01:26:51,134
Like what?

1329
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:52,595
Uncomfortable things about

1330
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,329
the source of my campaign funds.

1331
01:26:55,732 --> 01:26:57,560
Sounds serious. What's up?

1332
01:26:58,778 --> 01:27:00,017
Deputy Director.

1333
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:04,517
Mr. Danforth, are you familiar
with, uh, United Data Group?

1334
01:27:05,797 --> 01:27:07,668
United Data Group.

1335
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:11,494
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

1336
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,565
I invested in that.

1337
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:14,967
I invest everywhere.

1338
01:27:14,968 --> 01:27:16,491
I mean, there's... It's everywhere.

1339
01:27:16,492 --> 01:27:18,212
- It's very diverse.
- Uh-huh.

1340
01:27:18,237 --> 01:27:21,197
How about, uh, Nine Star United?

1341
01:27:24,165 --> 01:27:25,687
Yeah, that was, uh...

1342
01:27:25,712 --> 01:27:28,236
that's more of, like,
a consulting type role.

1343
01:27:28,261 --> 01:27:30,479
It's block chain issues.
And you probably...

1344
01:27:30,504 --> 01:27:33,114
I don't want to bore you with all that.

1345
01:27:34,055 --> 01:27:37,889
What do you know about
a classified algorithmic

1346
01:27:37,914 --> 01:27:39,393
data mining software package

1347
01:27:39,418 --> 01:27:42,009
developed by the
intelligence community?

1348
01:27:55,922 --> 01:27:57,228
He's here.

1349
01:27:58,067 --> 01:27:59,982
All stations, target's in
the building. East wing.

1350
01:28:00,006 --> 01:28:01,529
<i>Give me everything you got.</i>

1351
01:28:01,554 --> 01:28:02,642
He's in the house!

1352
01:28:03,216 --> 01:28:05,173
Assault team, saddle up!

1353
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:06,677
Let's move, boys! Get a move on!

1354
01:28:06,702 --> 01:28:07,889
Let's move! Come on!

1355
01:28:07,914 --> 01:28:10,272
- Go! Come on. Move!
- Go! Go!

1356
01:28:11,714 --> 01:28:13,698
Break-break! Package is in the house!

1357
01:28:13,723 --> 01:28:15,550
Level three, side four.

1358
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:18,336
Blue over blue, you see
him, you fucking get him!

1359
01:28:18,803 --> 01:28:21,506
Hey! Put your fucking hands up.

1360
01:28:23,295 --> 01:28:25,139
Now turn the fuck around.

1361
01:28:29,695 --> 01:28:31,480
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

1362
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:35,787
He's outside. Target's outside.

1363
01:28:35,788 --> 01:28:37,311
Move! Move!

1364
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,796
Let's get this fucking guy!

1365
01:28:38,821 --> 01:28:40,475
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, killer. You see him?

1366
01:28:40,499 --> 01:28:41,671
Negative.

1367
01:28:42,813 --> 01:28:44,468
- Clay!
- That's right.

1368
01:28:46,409 --> 01:28:49,280
That's right. Now, on your knees!

1369
01:28:49,305 --> 01:28:51,046
On your knees!

1370
01:28:52,228 --> 01:28:54,448
Lace your fingers behind your head.

1371
01:28:56,568 --> 01:29:00,499
Down on your knees now!

1372
01:29:00,524 --> 01:29:01,830
Do it now!

1373
01:29:07,603 --> 01:29:10,954
Beekeeper, huh? God's right hand?

1374
01:29:11,452 --> 01:29:12,583
You aren't shit.

1375
01:29:12,608 --> 01:29:13,782
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1376
01:29:13,783 --> 01:29:14,983
Hey, take a step back.

1377
01:29:15,552 --> 01:29:17,588
I'm putting this asshole's
brains on the lawn.

1378
01:29:17,613 --> 01:29:19,483
What are you doing?
He's not even armed.

1379
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:20,866
Armed?

1380
01:29:20,891 --> 01:29:23,389
As long as this motherfucker's
breathing, he's armed.

1381
01:29:23,414 --> 01:29:25,966
You're not fucking executing him.

1382
01:29:25,991 --> 01:29:27,689
Nice crowd you're rolling with.

1383
01:29:35,633 --> 01:29:36,808
Watch me.

1384
01:29:37,788 --> 01:29:39,243
V, what the fuck is going on?

1385
01:29:39,789 --> 01:29:42,488
To "bee" or not to "bee"?

1386
01:29:42,513 --> 01:29:44,602
Isn't that the bloody question?

1387
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:46,729
I think I'll take

1388
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:48,780
to "bee."

1389
01:29:59,218 --> 01:30:01,177
- Wiley?
- Yeah, you good?

1390
01:30:01,178 --> 01:30:02,222
- Yeah.
- Go.

1391
01:30:04,229 --> 01:30:05,926
Get off me!

1392
01:30:07,837 --> 01:30:09,316
He's fucking mine!

1393
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:12,057
Talk to me, people. I need news.

1394
01:30:21,285 --> 01:30:22,459
He's here!

1395
01:30:22,484 --> 01:30:24,312
Go! Go! All stations!

1396
01:30:27,204 --> 01:30:29,379
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1397
01:30:33,911 --> 01:30:35,128
Go with the flow.

1398
01:30:35,168 --> 01:30:36,647
Not clear. He's not clear.

1399
01:30:36,648 --> 01:30:37,909
Hang tight.

1400
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:39,129
On me.

1401
01:30:58,866 --> 01:31:01,238
Get on the ground. Get on the ground.

1402
01:31:04,023 --> 01:31:06,460
You understand you did this, right?

1403
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,569
You broke the rules.

1404
01:31:07,594 --> 01:31:09,905
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning system.

1405
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:12,018
I was just trying to get
you into office, Mom.

1406
01:31:12,043 --> 01:31:13,289
How else do you think you got elected?

1407
01:31:13,313 --> 01:31:15,553
I was going to win with
or without your help.

1408
01:31:15,589 --> 01:31:18,997
We were already rich. Your
father built an empire.

1409
01:31:19,022 --> 01:31:20,928
Yeah. And you were going to fucking

1410
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:22,824
break it up into pieces and sell it off.

1411
01:31:22,825 --> 01:31:24,303
Well, in the name of public service

1412
01:31:24,304 --> 01:31:26,958
because I care and I want
to leave a better world.

1413
01:31:26,959 --> 01:31:27,999
Okay. Right.

1414
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:29,874
Yeah, because you hate the fact

1415
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:30,913
that being the president

1416
01:31:30,938 --> 01:31:32,498
is just like an endless cocktail party.

1417
01:31:32,539 --> 01:31:33,931
You realize that you were behind

1418
01:31:33,956 --> 01:31:35,943
in 15 of 20 counties you needed to win.

1419
01:31:35,968 --> 01:31:37,621
15 of 20 counties!

1420
01:31:37,622 --> 01:31:40,507
I taught CIA software to hunt money

1421
01:31:40,532 --> 01:31:41,794
and not terrorists.

1422
01:31:43,614 --> 01:31:44,919
You didn't hear that.

1423
01:31:58,205 --> 01:32:00,163
You got elected because
of me, and you know that.

1424
01:32:00,188 --> 01:32:02,876
Yeah, I know it. Everyone knows it.

1425
01:32:02,901 --> 01:32:05,088
Now I know where the
money came from...

1426
01:32:05,113 --> 01:32:06,505
and all the people you hurt.

1427
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:09,216
Okay, whatever. It's
computer data, Mom.

1428
01:32:09,241 --> 01:32:10,602
Somebody in this family has
to have their fucking feet

1429
01:32:10,626 --> 01:32:13,026
on the ground to actually get
shit done. You understand that?

1430
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:32,680
Mom, the wolves are at the
fucking door right now.

1431
01:32:32,705 --> 01:32:34,592
What are you going to do to fix this?

1432
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:39,483
Tell the truth.

1433
01:32:41,339 --> 01:32:42,644
The fucking...

1434
01:32:42,669 --> 01:32:44,496
What does that even mean?

1435
01:32:44,521 --> 01:32:46,565
What does that even mean,
tell the fucking truth?

1436
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,851
You have an entire building

1437
01:32:47,876 --> 01:32:49,069
full of PR people

1438
01:32:49,094 --> 01:32:50,640
that are going to choose
the right way forward.

1439
01:32:50,664 --> 01:32:53,057
That guy who's coming to
kill us, that Beekeeper,

1440
01:32:53,082 --> 01:32:55,953
I'm telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1441
01:32:55,978 --> 01:32:57,675
Then I'm telling the entire nation.

1442
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,984
And if it costs me everything,

1443
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:01,488
well, so be it.

1444
01:34:15,084 --> 01:34:16,389
You fucking git!

1445
01:34:22,613 --> 01:34:23,614
Fuck!

1446
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,142
You're just a man.

1447
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:31,977
I know.

1448
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:26,452
Thank you.

1449
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:04,802
Jesus. Looks like a
tornado came through here.

1450
01:36:10,546 --> 01:36:12,069
What's your plan here, huh?

1451
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:13,445
You're going to tell this
guy the fucking truth

1452
01:36:13,469 --> 01:36:15,109
and hope that he spares
you and kills me instead?

1453
01:36:15,133 --> 01:36:16,395
No, Derek, I'll tell him the truth

1454
01:36:16,419 --> 01:36:17,850
because it's the truth.

1455
01:36:27,869 --> 01:36:30,001
It's gone far enough.
You've proved your point.

1456
01:36:30,862 --> 01:36:33,257
Beekeepers live for the good of society.

1457
01:36:34,827 --> 01:36:36,094
I'm retired.

1458
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:38,662
This is personal.

1459
01:36:39,616 --> 01:36:41,186
All the more reason to stop.

1460
01:36:42,778 --> 01:36:45,041
Go back. Live a quiet life.

1461
01:36:45,672 --> 01:36:47,678
Making honey for your neighbors.

1462
01:36:47,905 --> 01:36:49,281
That's all I wanted.

1463
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:53,265
- My neighbor's dead.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1464
01:36:53,329 --> 01:36:55,852
But do you live in the real world

1465
01:36:55,853 --> 01:36:57,507
or just protect it?

1466
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,104
What does it matter to you

1467
01:37:02,129 --> 01:37:04,837
how presidents come to be elected?

1468
01:37:04,862 --> 01:37:07,082
- Hm?
- It doesn't.

1469
01:37:07,444 --> 01:37:09,258
What does matter to you?

1470
01:37:09,897 --> 01:37:11,173
Right and wrong.

1471
01:37:12,077 --> 01:37:13,566
It's not fashionable.

1472
01:37:14,585 --> 01:37:16,394
I believe there's good in the universe.

1473
01:37:16,395 --> 01:37:20,573
Yeah, well, we agree.
I mean, that's my view.

1474
01:37:21,742 --> 01:37:23,744
Until the Danforth family bought you.

1475
01:37:24,327 --> 01:37:26,231
- Ah.
- You can stop pretending.

1476
01:37:27,111 --> 01:37:29,968
We wouldn't need Beekeepers
if it wasn't for men like you.

1477
01:37:30,454 --> 01:37:31,693
Don't do that.

1478
01:37:31,718 --> 01:37:33,225
Sir, you might want to step back.

1479
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,319
No.

1480
01:37:34,344 --> 01:37:37,022
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1481
01:37:38,744 --> 01:37:39,875
Now, have a seat.

1482
01:37:44,151 --> 01:37:47,414
Nah, fuck the truth, man. The truth...

1483
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:48,788
- Wait. You put that down.
- No, Derek.

1484
01:37:48,812 --> 01:37:50,161
Comes out of your fucking...

1485
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,662
Jesus Christ!

1486
01:37:52,687 --> 01:37:53,967
That's fucking real right there.

1487
01:38:06,358 --> 01:38:08,682
- Clay, no!
- Drop your weapon. Drop it!

1488
01:38:25,389 --> 01:38:27,205
You decide who you work for.

1489
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:30,643
For the law

1490
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:33,860
or for justice.

1491
01:38:37,085 --> 01:38:38,173
Fuck this.

1492
01:38:38,608 --> 01:38:39,608
Bye, Mom.

1493
01:38:46,181 --> 01:38:47,788
- Go! Go!
- Move. Move.

1494
01:38:47,813 --> 01:38:49,811
- Move it out. Out of the way.
- You're okay.

1495
01:38:49,836 --> 01:38:52,883
- I got you. I got you.
- No. No. I want my...

1496
01:38:54,241 --> 01:38:55,407
Clay!

1497
01:38:58,889 --> 01:39:00,231
Come with us right now!

1498
01:39:01,065 --> 01:39:04,198
- No! I want my... I want my...
- Back away. Back away.

1499
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:05,575
No!

1500
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,253
You need to come with me. Come on.

1501
01:39:07,278 --> 01:39:08,975
- No!
- Move out. Move out.

1502
01:39:09,895 --> 01:39:12,114
- Give me your hand. Come on!
- No!

1503
01:39:25,099 --> 01:39:26,579
{\an8}Goodbye, Adam Clay.

1504
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:29,908
<b>Keep eyes on! Let's go!</b>

1505
01:49:27,601 --> 01:49:29,908
Keep eyes on! Let's go!
