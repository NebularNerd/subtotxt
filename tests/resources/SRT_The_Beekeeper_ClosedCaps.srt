there is something

called a "queen slayer."

1446
01:17:09,177 --> 01:17:13,144
It’s a bee that will rise up
and kill the queen

for the greater good.

1453

believes that Derek Danforth

is the defective offspring
of a queen,

1455
01:17:37,507 --> 01:17:41,177
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1456
01:17:41,177 --> 01:17:44,243
and become a queen slayer.
